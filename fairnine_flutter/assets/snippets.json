I specialize in React, TypeScript, Rust, and cloud-native architectures.\n\nPreviously, I led engineering teams at two Y Combinator startups, shipping products used by over 500,000 developers worldwide. I'm passionate about developer tooling, performance optimization, and open-source contributions.\n\nWhen I'm not coding, you'll find me mentoring junior developers, speaking at tech conferences, or experimenting with new programming languages. I believe great software is built at the intersection of empathy and engineering rigor."
